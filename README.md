## WallKickers

WallKickers is a simple replica of the existing game "Wallkickers," developed as part of a project submission at UIB.

The game utilizes a single button: the space bar controls menu navigation and gameplay. Press to jump, hold for higher jumps, and press again while in the air to change direction or perform a backflip.

The initial release includes 11 levels, including a starting level and 10 other levels chosen randomly by the game. These levels feature various structures composed of different obstacles/walls:

- **Wall**: Standard wall.
- **SpikeWall**: Deadly wall.
- **BlinkWall**: Wall that disappears and reappears.
- **ElectricWall**: Wall that toggles between deadly and normal.
- **BounceWall**: Wall that automatically triggers a jump, bouncing the player off it.

The objective of the game is to ascend as high as possible. WallKickers saves high scores to incentivize reaching new heights.

The game is developed using object-oriented programming and follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
